# Balance Manager App

### ToDo list (Tito)

+ amount values aren't updating after deleting a transaction.
+ recycleView need to implement a list view in recycleViewItem (for only one date by day is showed).
+ janky abstract class (Transactions).
+ Edit Expense/Income aren't using editExpense/Income methods from their respectives DAOs.


#### Minor Issues
+ need to create a attribute on main acitivty to hold total amount (income-expense) to other activities only need to access this attribute to protrai it.
+ (in Edit_Transaction_Activity) make fragToStart a global variable, since it's used everywhere in this activity.
